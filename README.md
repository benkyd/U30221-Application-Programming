If the scope allowed for it, every function would be (reasonably) unit tested. 

The solution to locale-ise language in HTML is extremely naive and there are a lot better ways to do it, i did what i could in the time without a full refractor and SSR.
However it is not at much detriment of readability and maintainability of the code so i didn't deem it neccesary.

The locales are stored in different language files so it is easier for people to contribute and thus more maintanable.
